# Project_army

This is a repository with algorithms and codes for solving coding problems from various websites(including, InterviewCake, Leetcode, Programmers, Baekjoon, etc.). The purpose of this repository is purely for the sake of keeping track of our achievements and to keep ourselves disciplined as developers throughout our military service.

Background
-------------
Enlisiting to the Korean Army has provided me with an extremely challenging environment to code. Limited access to electronic devices(around 2-3 hours a day) and computers w/o permission to access the terminal have prevented me from coding freely as I did before. Therefore, my friend, John and I have decided to record our daily coding challenges on github to keep track of our achievements and to have further discussions on the codes that we implemented.
